          Three weeks ago in the Pesach Haggada we recited that "... in
          every
          generation they rise against us to destroy us; and the Holy
          One,
          blessed be He, saves us from their hand". And so with the help
          of G-d
          the Jewish nation exist today and will continue to do so with
          His
          help. My mother ע"ה had endured the most horrible attempted
          annihilation of the Jews in her own life. When we were
          children we
          learned very little from her about what really happenend. But
          towards
          the end of her life she opened herself to us and to our
          children and
          shared with us in detail the horrendous experience that she
          and her
          family endured during the war. We, as second generation,
          cannot even
          fathom what Jews endured during the war. Nevertheless, my
          Mother
          succceeded to somehow leave the horrors behind and start a
          new life.
          My mother was a fighter and thus she struggled starting at
          her arrival in
          Switzerland to build a new good life. She was also fortunate,
          l'havidil ben chaim le chaim, to have met my father and
          together with
          him to have been able to build a Jewish home.

          I would like to mention two or three details about my Mother ע"ה
          which have
          especially impressed me. Foremost, certainly must be mentioned
          her
          love for Eretz Yisroel. Already my Grandfather זצ"ל was an
          ardent
          advocate for the establishment of Israel, in spite of the fact
          that as
          Chief Rabbi of Klausenburg, this did not win sympathy for him.
          Also my
          Mother was a true Zionist. Whenever Zionism was the topic her
          eyes lit
          up and she strove everywhere to portray this subject in a
          positive
          light.
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
          I cannot and must not forget the Shabbosim that I experienced
          in my
          parents' home. My Mother ע"ה regarded it worthy to spread a
          Shabbos
          spirit and not just through her fantastic cooking skills. I am
          convinced that as a result of this Ruach our Emunah and love
          of
          Judaism was greatly strengthened.
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
          Another trait that distinguished my Mother was her
          unextinguishable
          will to live. Until the last day, she never considered
          surrendering or
          thought that this could be her last moment in this world. She
          wanted
          life and always expressed how important it was for her to see
          her
          grandchildren and great grandchildren. She had the zechus,
          which is
          not selfevident and we all thank G-d for this, to see all her
          grandchildren under the chuppa.
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
          She repeatedly expressed the wish that G-d may grant her some
          time to
          experience this and to still be together with with my father.
	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
          And G-d did grant her three years after the beginning of her
          illness
          during which she was able to experience chasanas of two
          grandchildren
          and the birth of four great grandchildren. We are all thankful
          for this
          gift from the Almighty and it should be comforting to all of
          us,
          especially my father, that she was still able to have these
          experiences. Dear Mother, we will never forget you. Please be
          a Melitz Yosher for
          our whole family and Klall Yisroel at G-d's Throne.
