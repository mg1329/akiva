Dear Opi, (Grampa)<br>
Dear Papi (Daddy) and Ruth,<br>
Dear Family and Friends,
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
One and a half weeks ago Am Yisrael mourned the victims of the Shoah
and then during the following week the fallen soldiers of Yisrael.  
Then Am Yisrael celebrated Yom Ha'atzmaut. Today we gather together 
to observe our own day of rememberance, that of our Omi.
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
This time of the year, full with sadness and happiness in the 
modern history of our people, is so befitting to be the time
of Omi's yom hazikaron
because these events have marked Omi's whole life.
As a young girl Omi herself experienced
horrors of the Shoah, 
horrors which  instill unspeakable feelings and fears that
accompany people their entire lives, and which did so for Omi.
Nevertheless these events have
created an affiliation  and connection to Am Yisrael to which Omi
clung her entire life.  More than anything else Omi mourned the loss
of her sister Naomi whose murder raised questions that were never
satisfactorily answered; the enormity of the numbers of murdered 
brothers and sisters being such that retelling the history of each and every 
lost soul is not possible.
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
And yet, as Omi on a Yom Hashoa mourned and
remembered, on Yom Ha'atzmaut she observered and celebrated. She
regarded  the State
of Israel as
the happiness that the catastrophe of the Holocaust unleashed, as the
Triumph of God's
people against another villain whose mission to destroy the Jews failed, 
and as a miracle that created a new history and future for the Jews. 
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
It is not without reason that these days of joy immediately follow the days of
mourning the
lost heroes of our people and country. This roller coaster of
emotions reflects the rationalism and realism of our faith. No happiness
can be valued without previous suffering and no suffering without
subsequent happiness can
be endured. 
Through the course of history it has been confirmed time and time again that 
Judaism itself could never have survived, let alone been strengthened,
during the millennia of diaspora
without constant persecution of and threat to the Jewish
community.
	  </span></p>
        <p><span class="c1">
In light of this, it is the duty of virtually every Jewish generation,
to maintain
its identity and to trust in G-d's protection, and to choose  life
and happiness over 
death and mourning. Omi did this, and as her descendants it is our duty
to emulate her. 
So we are here today to mourn the loss of our
beloved wife, mother and grandmother, but at the same time celebrate
her life, achievements and heritage. 
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
Omi's personal revenge against the perpetrators of the Holocaust,
Yimach Shemom, consisted of  maintaining her faith, 
starting a new life, marrying and raising a family,  expanding
Judaism rather than decimating it.
	  	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">
The Glasner dynasty whose reign ended abruptly and violently, and one
of whose last witnesses was Omi, is being continued. Although we cannot
match the Gadlus b'Torah of
our Hungarian ancestors, we try to continue their legacy by 
maintaning their traditions, by sharing their Jewish
beliefs, their courage and their integrity. 
	  </span></p>
	        <p><span class="c1">	
I have so many more questions to ask Omi that will never be answered.
And I yearn to taste her food, to interact Omi and Opi in their
living room, and to climb with her the Trutz (a mountain in St. Moritz); 
also these desires will remain unfulfilled. 
But Omi will never be forgotten by us, her  liveliness always remain before
our eyes and the Hungarian blood far more than just a
quarter of our heritage, will contiue to flow in our veins. And when,
one day in the distant future, Omi's memory fades with our generation,
then small Schulamis Bliime will continue the history writing as Omi Mimi.
